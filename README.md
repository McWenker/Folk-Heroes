# Folk Heroes

Hello and welcome to Folk Heroes, an upcoming indie RPGenre bender designed and developed by yours truly.

## Concept

Folk Heroes hopes to capture some of the basebuilding fun of classic games like Stronghold or Age of Empires, while blending it with a bullet-hell RPG that will probably never stop expanding in scope and reach (please help me).

## Features
#### Command Modes
   Only by mastering both Combat and Command, will you become a worthy Folk Hero...

![ConstructionGif](DemoImages/constructionDemo.gif?raw=true "The early iterations of construction")

#### Building
   Protect your Gatherers, and use their efforts to forge an empire...

#### Allies and Enemies
   Fear not, you are not in this fight alone...

## Next Steps
#### Abilities and Classes
   Guns are only the beginning! Swords, spells, bombs, and much more is in the plan...

#### Procedural Generation
	Caves, dungeons, and other random spots inhabited by Goblins, Trolls, Ogres, and such... fantasy!

#### More Art, A Story
   Eventually this shit will have to have some kind of theme... right?

## Changelog
The changelog has been moved, and is now available [here.](changelog.md)

## Trying the Demo Thusfar

While I highly do not recommend you try to play the game in its current state (it's ugly and bad), if you insist...

### Prerequisites

You will need a copy of the [UnityEditor](https://unity3d.com/)

	1) Download the repository
	2) Open your UnityEditor
		a) locate the Unity Projects directory (or create it)
	3) Create a new Project
		a) title it "Folk Heroes" to ensure compatability (maybe? I have no idea if that will matter)
	4) Clone this Repo
		a) paste the contents of the cloned directory into the "Folk Heroes" project folder, merging and replacing existing files
	5) ??????
	6) Profit!
