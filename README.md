# Folk Heroes

Hello and welcome to Folk Heroes, an upcoming indie RPGenre bender designed and developed by yours truly.

## Concept

Folk Heroes hopes to capture some of the basebuilding fun of classic games like Stronghold or Age of Empires, while blending it with a bullet-hell RPG that will probably never stop expanding in scope and reach (please help me).

## Trying the Demo Thusfar

While I highly do not recommend you try to play the game in its current state (it's ugly and bad), if you insist...

### Prerequisites

You will need a copy of the [UnityEditor](https://unity3d.com/)

	1) Download the repository
	2) Open your UnityEditor
		a) locate the Unity Projects directory (or create it)
	3) Create a new Project
		a) title it "Folk Heroes" to ensure compatability (maybe? I have no idea if that will matter)
	4) Clone this Repo
		a) paste the contents of the cloned directory into the "Folk Heroes" project folder, merging and replacing existing files
	5) ??????
	6) Profit!
