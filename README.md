# Folk Heroes

Hello and welcome to Folk Heroes, an upcoming indie RPGenre bender designed and developed by yours truly.

## Concept

Folk Heroes hopes to capture some of the basebuilding fun of classic games like Stronghold or Age of Empires, while blending it with a bullet-hell RPG that will probably never stop expanding in scope.

## Trying the Demo Thusfar

While I highly do not recommend you try to play the game in its current state (it's ugly and bad), if you insist...

### Prerequisites

You will need a copy of the [UnityEditor](https://unity3d.com/)
Further instructions may be necessary here in the future...
