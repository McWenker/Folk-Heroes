# Folk Heroes

Hello and welcome to Folk Heroes, an upcoming indie RPGenre bender designed and developed by yours truly.

## Concept

Folk Heroes hopes to capture the placid joy of farming simulators like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley, while maintaining the combative edge of action RPGs.
The player will not only maintain a farm for aesthetics and income, their community depends on them for food--and defense...

## Please Forgive Our Appearance
With the revival of this project, a lot of the scope and target product has changed. I will be revamping this README as I continue to flesh out the goal (and make cool GIFs of features). Thanks for understanding!

## Changelog
